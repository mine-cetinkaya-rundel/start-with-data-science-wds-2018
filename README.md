# start-with-data-science-wds-2018

Slides for the "Start with data science" talk at the 2018 [Women in Data Science Conference](http://www.science.smith.edu/wdsboston/).

## Abstract

In this talk we will discuss a data science course designed to serve as a gateway to the discipline of statistics, the statistics major, and broadly to quantitative studies. The course is intended for students with little to no computing or statistical background, and focuses on data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and effective communication. In this talk we will give a brief overview of the course, and discuss its success in achieving a gender balance in its audience, and attracting these students to the statistical science major.
